# My List of Awesome AI Tools

This is my personal list of AI tools I actually use and like.  It's not a comprehensive list just the stuff I like.

Am I missing something I absolutely should try?  [Drop me a note on X](https://x.com/APSquaredDev) or on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/apsquared.bsky.social).

## General Tools

**[Chat GPT](https://www.chatgpt.com)** - Paid for Plus.  Stool very useful to me.


## Dev Tools

**[Cursor](https://www.cursor.com)** - Absolute game change for "vibe coding".


## Image / Logo Creation


## Creatives

**[Napkin](https://www.napkin.ai)** - Really cool tool for creating informational graphics


## MCP Servers
**[MCP-Mongo-Server](https://github.com/kiliczsh/mcp-mongo-server)** - First MCP I got working

## MCP Directories
**[MCP.so](https://mcp.so/)** - Found the mongo server here, that said lots of junk to sift through.
